----

**`xtpxlib`** is a library containing software for processing XML, using languages like 
XSLT, XProc etc. It consists of several separate components, named `xtpxlib-*`. Everything can be found on GitHub ([https://github.com/eriksiegel](https://github.com/eriksiegel)).

**`xtpxlib-common`** ([https://github.com/eriksiegel/xtpxlib-common](https://github.com/eriksiegel/xtpxlib-common)) is the common, shared, component of xtpxlib. It is used by most other `xtpxlib `components.

----

## Using `xtpxlib`

* Clone the GitHub repository to some appropriate location on disk. That's basicly it for installation.
* If you use more than one `xtpxlib` component, all repositories must be cloned in the same base directory.

## Library contents

### Directories at root level

| Directory | Description | Remarks |
| --------- | ----------- | --------|
| `data` | Static data files used by `xtpxlib`. Some may be general purpose. |  |
| `etc` | Other files, mostly for use inside oXygen. |  |
| `template` | Templates to base new files on.  | Some of them contain oXygen macros. |
| `xplmod` | XProc 1.0 libraries |  |
| `xqmod` | XQuery libraries. | Any libraries here are derived from the XSLT libraries in `/xslmod` for usage in eXist. No guarantees they work somewhere else. |
| `xsd` | Schemas for some of the datafiles used or generated by this component. |  |
| `xsl` | XSLT scripts |  |
| `xslmod` | XSLT libraries | Contains a README file of its own, summarizing the various libraries. |

The subdirectories named `tmp` and  `build` may appear while running parts of the library. These directories are for temporary and build results. Git will ignore them because of the `.gitignore` settings.

Most files contain a header comment about what they're for.

## Main conventions used in `xtpxlib`

### Commonly used (sub)directory names

| Directory | Description |
| --------- | ----------- |
| `assets` | Binary static assets (images, etc.)
| `bin` | Executable binaries and/or batch/shell files | 
| `data` | Static datafiles |
| `doc` | Documentation |
| `etc` | Anything that does not fit in one of the other categories. |
| `test` | Files that have to do with testing parts of the library (test drivers, test specifications, etc.) | 
| `xpl` | XProc scripts |
| `xplmod` | XProc modules/libraries |
| `xqmod` | XQuery modules |
| `xsl` | XSLT scripts |
| `xslmod` | XSLT modules/libraries |

### File- and Directory-name Conventions

* All file- and directory-names are in lower-case.
* Words/parts in names are separated with hyphens (e.g. `this-is-a-name`).
* Normal extensions are used (e.g. `.xsl`, `.xml`, etc.)
* For a file that contains a module or library, the extension is prefixed with `.mod.` (e.g. `xslt-library.mod.xsl`)

### Common XML Conventions

* All names (elements, attributes, prefixes, etc.) are in lower-case.
* Words/parts in names are separated with hyphens (e.g. `this-is-a-name`).
* Wherever possible (and appropriate), namespaces are used:
* xtpxlib namespace prefixes start with `xtl`, short for xtpxlib. (e.g. `xtlc` for `http:\\www.xtpxlib.nl\ns\common`)
